# Hypernymy Suite

HypernymySuite is a tool for evaluating some hypernymy detection modules. Its
predominant focus is reproducing the results for the following paper.

> Stephen Roller, Douwe Kiela, and Maximilian Nickel. 2018. Hearst Patterns
> Revisited: Automatic Hypernym Detection from Large Text Corpora. ACL.
> ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.03191))

We hope that open sourcing our evaluation will help facilitate future research.

## Example

You can produce results in a JSON format by calling main.py:

    python main.py cnt --dset hearst_counts.txt.gz

These results can be made machine readable by piping them into `compile_table`:

    python main.py cnt --dset hearst_counts.txt.gz | python compile_table.py

To generate the full table from the report, you may simply use `generate_table.sh`:

    bash generate_table.sh results.json

Please note that due to licensing concerns, we were not able to release our
train/validation/test folds from the paper, so results may differ slightly than
those reported.

## Requirements

The module was developed with python3 in mind, and is not tested for python2.
Nonetheless, cross-platform compatibility may be possible.

The suite requires several packages you probably already have installed:
`numpy`, `scipy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn` and `nltk`. These can be installed
using pip:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

If you've never used `nltk` before, you'll need to install the wordnet module.

    python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('wordnet')"
    
On OS X, you may need to install `coreutils` and `gnu-sed` for the script `download_data.sh` to run correctly. These can be installed using brew:

    brew install coreutils gnu-sed

After installation, you will either need to modify `download_data.sh` to run `gsort` and `gsed` instead of `sort` and `sed`, or alternatively add a "gnubin" directory to your PATH from your bashrc:

    PATH="/usr/local/opt/coreutils/libexec/gnubin:$PATH"

For more information, see `brew info coreutils` or `brew info gnu-sed`.

## Evaluating your own model

You can evaluate your own model in two separate ways. The simplest way is simply
to create a copy of example.tsv, and fill in your model's predictions in the `sim`
column. You must include a prediction for every pair, but you may set the `is_oov`
column to `1` to ensure it is correctly calculated.

You may then evaluate the model:

    python main.py precomputed --dset example.tsv

You can also implement any model by extending the `base.HypernymySuiteModel` class
and filling in your own implemenation for `predict` or `predict_many`.
